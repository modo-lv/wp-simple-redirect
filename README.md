# Simple Redirects (plugin for WordPress)
A fork of Scott Nell√©'s "Simple 301 Redirects" WordPress plugin.

## Changes
* Redirects work regardless of address used (i.e., will work on both "domain.com" and "www.domain.com" if the wordpress itself works on both).

## Installation
* Deactivate or remove "Simple 301 Redirects" plugin if you have it activated.
* Create a `wp-simple-redirects` folder in `wp-content/plugins` and place `wp-simple-redirects.php` in there.
* Activate the plugin from admin panel.
